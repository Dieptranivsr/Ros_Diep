Ripes is a graphical processor simulator and assembly code editor built for the [RISC-V instruction set architecture](https://content.riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/riscv-spec-v2.2.pdf), suitable for teaching how assembly level code is executed on various microarchitectures.

## Usage
If this is your first time using Ripes, please refer to the [introduction](https://github.com/mortbopet/Ripes/wiki/(2.0)-Introduction).  
For further information, please refer to the [Ripes wiki](https://github.com/mortbopet/Ripes/wiki).

## Downloading & Installation
Prebuilt binaries are available for Linux, Windows & Mac. These are available through the [Releases page](https://github.com/mortbopet/Ripes/releases).  

### Linux
Releases for Linux are distributed in the AppImage format. To run an AppImage:
* Run `chmod a+x` on the AppImage file
* Run the file!
The AppImage for Linux should be compatible with most Linux distributions.

### Windows
For Windows, the C++ runtime library must be available (if not, a msvcp140.dll error will be produced). You most likely already have this installed, but if this is not the case, you download it [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145).

## Building
Assuming you have installed a recent version of [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download) as well as [CMake](https://cmake.org/), Ripes may be built like any other CMake project:
```
Unix:               Windows:
cd Ripes/           cd Ripes/
cmake .             cmake .
make                jom.exe / nmake.exe / ...
```
Note, that you must have Qt 5 available in your `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`. The easiest way to use CMake with Qt is to set the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` environment variable to the install prefix of Qt 5.
